Using the notebook, we proceed to read the source code contained in a directory tree and build a json variable for d3.js to show graphical analysis of the analyzed php system.

Using the notebook, we proceed to read the source code contained in a directory tree and build a json variable for d3.js to show graphical analysis of the analyzed php system.
The graphic analysis shows different aspects, inherent to the source code, such as location within the directory tree, relationship between scripts and cluster to which it is classified using unsupervised machine learning.


The notebook can be adapted for other purposes by making slight changes.
